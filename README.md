# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose 
The school board performed an analysis using Pandas/Python on budget and grade performance on a district level for high schools.

For this project the school board requested the same framework but omitting Thomas High 9th grade information.

## Development Enviroment 

- Python 3.7.7
- Jupyter Notebooks
